# Regex Spaceship

Regex Spaceship is a web-based multiplayer game that helps players fine tune their RegEx syntax. As an astronaut, players must run around their ship, fixing broken control panels by writing Regular Expressions. You must fix all the control panels before time runs out, or you'll be lost in space forever!

## Getting Started

1.  Fork and clone this repo.
2.  `npm install`.
3.  Create `regex-spaceship` and `regex-spaceship-test` databases. See schema diagram at the bottom of this file.
4.  Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start-dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
5.  Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the site in the browser.
6.  Check out the mock-view in `wireframes` at the bottom of this file to see the basic layout of the site.
7.  Run the tests with: `npm test`.
8.  Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
